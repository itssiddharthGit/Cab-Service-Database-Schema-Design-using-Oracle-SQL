Cab Service Database Schema Design using MySQL

Project Overview:
This project focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive database management system for a cab service. The schema was developed with careful consideration for data integrity, security, and efficient query optimization. It uses MySQL as the relational database management system.

Project Duration: January - May 2023

Project Type: Personal Project

Key Features:
* Designed an ER diagram on Oracle SQL database to model the data relationships within the cab service.
* Implemented the schema design with normalized tables for key entities like Users, Drivers, Vehicles, Trips, Payments, and Feedback.
* Ensured data integrity and consistency through constraints, relationships, and indexing.
* Applied query optimization techniques for better performance.
* Managed application data with a focus on scalability, reliability, and security.

Database Entities
The following tables were designed as part of this schema:

Users: Stores user details like user ID, name, contact information, and address.
Drivers: Contains driver information including driver ID, name, contact, license details, and rating.
Vehicles: Maintains vehicle details like vehicle ID, type, registration number, and availability.
Trips: Captures trip details such as trip ID, start and end locations, time, fare, and status.
Payments: Records payment details including payment ID, method, amount, and associated trip.
Feedback: Stores user feedback for trips, linking it to users, drivers, and trips.

ER Diagram
The ER diagram was created to illustrate relationships between different entities, ensuring that the database design supports all necessary operations within the cab service.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Database: MySQL (Schema designed and implemented initially in Oracle SQL)
Languages: SQL
Tools: Oracle SQL Developer

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Import the SQL scripts to set up the database structure.
Run the queries provided to perform various operations (CRUD) on the database.

Future Enhancements
Integration with a frontend application.
Implementation of advanced analytics for trip and driver performance.
Additional security layers for sensitive data.
